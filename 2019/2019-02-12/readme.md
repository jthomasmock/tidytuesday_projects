# R&D Budget

Wanted to recreate some sparklines-esque plots in `ggplot2` - I thought the free y-axis was necessary as there was such a difference in levels of spending (DOD super high, interior so low).


### Some resources I used
[Sparkline walkthrough](https://education.arcus.chop.edu/sparklines-ggplot2/)
[SO Sparklines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35434760/sparklines-in-ggplot2)
